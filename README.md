### Hello! My name is SerumHydra!

#### What is there about me? 
Well, I'm a small streamer from the UK! And I use They/Them pronouns. I stream a variety of games, from FIFA 22 to Phasmophobia to Minecraft! Which is my current favourite? I have no clue at all. I could honestly go on and on about the reason i started streaming and my influences behind it but I don't want to bore you with that.

In the home page you can find a lot of other streamers that I reccommend watching and most of them are people that you will catch me in a call with whilst streaming or while they are streaming.

I also play guitar and am starting to work on releasing music more and more. For now they may just be demos, yes, but I will eventually finish an EP and release a full mix & master!

As well as this, I code! It's not my main hobby but I am making a slow comeback to coding and to being over here on GitHub releasing things.
